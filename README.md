# Vews.

## Why you built this project / what does it solve?
- Lack of engagement in news, especially with young adults.
- People often rely on only one source of information for their news, creating a close minded view of the world.
- Everyone can be a journalist, but not many platforms allow for this.
- People can find it difficult to understand the public opinion on different topics.

## What technologies did you use?
React.js, Firebase, NewsAPI.org, Agora, Pusher/Chatkit, SCSS.

## How does the product tackle the problem?
A platform for expressing views on todayâ€™s headlines through crowdsourced live video.
Users take turns to voice their opinions on a top news story of the day and react to others' perspectives.
